# **INTRODUCING CSS**
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Rules are made of *selectors* (that specify the elements the rules applies to) and *declarations* (that indicate what these elements should look like)
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the *properties* of the element of what you want to change, and the *values* of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear withn an HTML page.
