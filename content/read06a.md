JavaScript 
JavaScript is written in plain text (just like HTML & CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.It is the best to keep JavaScript code on it own javascript file.
The HTML  <script>  element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the Javascript file (rather than the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). Web developers usually talk about 3 languages that are used to create web pages HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

HTML - Content layer ( .html files)
CSS - Presentation layer ( .css files)JavaScript - Behavior layer ( .js files)

If you view the source code of the page in the browser,  the JavaScript will not have change the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.Variable ( var ) before you used a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. Programmers say that you 'declare' the variable.
