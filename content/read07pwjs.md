Programing with JavaScript.

Script - is a series of instruction that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
Computer aproach task in different way than humans, so so yopur instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
To writte a script you need to first state your goal and then list the task that needed to be completed in order to achieve it.

Functions - functions let you group a series of statements togehter to perform a specific task. If different part of a script repeat the same task, you canm reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task.
Pieces of information passed to a function are known as a **parameters**.
When you writte a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a **return value**.
Declaring a Function - To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achive its task inside the curly braces. This is known as **function declaration**.
Calling a Function - Having declare a function, you can uthen execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is nkown as **calling the function**.
Sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. in such cases, when you declare the function you give it **parameters**. Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.
Whern you call a function that has a parameters, you specify the values it should in the parentheses that follow the name. the values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or as as variables.
