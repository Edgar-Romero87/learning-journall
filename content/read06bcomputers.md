# **HOW COMPUTERS WORK**
A computer is an electronic machine that processes information, it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called *input*, storing information is better known as *memory*(or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called *output*.

- **Input**-How the comp takes in what it needs to work on
- **Storage** -A place keep the inputs and data ready to be used for processing

- **Processing** -Runs the calculations on the inputs and the stored data so its ready for use.
- **Output** -The end result of the processing

# **CPU Memory input & output** 
- **Inputs** (mouse, keyboard,microphone)

- **Memory** (Ram, Hard Drive/SSD)

- **CPU** (CPUs, GPUs)

- **Outputs** (Monitor, Speakers)

# **Hardware and Software**

- Software controls the hardware.
- The OS is the master program.

# **The Internet**
- IP address (Internet protocol)
- DNS (Is a phonebook of the Internet)
